        <p>My name is Amber Douglas-Graham. Im joking about the "Graham" I only say that because it's my favorite musical artist's last name. Aubrey Drake Graham. Im 15 years old and still going strong. I am in  high school and I am pretty good at solving all the work that I am given, only thing is I absolutely hate homework, and when I say hate...I mean I HATE homework, so I don't always complete it at home (I usually do it in class). I plan on going to college but I won't be able to make it without changing my work habits and start dedicating more of my time to do a thorrough job on my homework and class work. I'm not quite sure what I want to do for my career, I'm stuck between an actress and a computer scientist (making websites and mobile apps). I'm pretty funny and pretty good at entertaining people, both jobs pay pretty well. I may just do both, you know like the little girl from the Old El Peso Commercial says "Por que no los dos?". Well I still have time to decide. Amber Douglas is my name and feel free to ask for my signature when you see me, it's like a pro. </p>
