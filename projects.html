 		I started the APP Academy just last year in 2013. This is my second "About Me" webpage. I have also made a side-scroll game and a brick-break game. I find the game making more fun than the actual webpage making. Second semester of last year a couple of us from the APP Academy went to the microsoft offices and made a website of our choice which was a great expericence considering I had never been there before. There was plenty of help given to us and the mentor for my group taught us plenty of diiferent techniques and why it would be good to continue to learn about computer programming. It made me want to stay and maybe even have a career in the industy. My APP Academy teacher this year explains to us everyday why we should continue programming and the benefits. I plan on creating a lot more websites and projects in the nearby future.
