      <p id="p1">I like movies, mostly comedies and action movies. I watch movies than I watch regular shows, I don't exacly have an explantion why I just find them more entertaining than tv shows. And I guess because a movie last longer than a tv show so I can be entertained longer. I'm not quite sure. I plan on having on a home theater when I get older because of my love for movies.</p>   
      
      <p id="p2">I also, really enjoy music, I spend most of my spare time on Pandora. I am most likely listening to music right now as you're reading this. I was even listening to music while I was typing this ("Pound Cake/ Paris Morton Music 2" by Drake to be exact). I listen to almost every genre except for rock I don't have anything against it, I'm just not a big fan. I mostly listen to rap and hip-hop, and any Drake song. #MusicIsLife</p> 

      <p id="p3">I'm pretty sure that you already get that I like Drake. He's my favorite and  he's my screen saver. I like almost all of his songs except for one. Why do I like him? Well because he's talented and he doesn't make your average song. The beat is always complex, his lyris aren't irrelevant, and he works hard on his music, it's not just whatever thrown together quickly to make some money quickly. (Just like before as I was typing this I was listening to "Recognize" by PARTYNEXTDOOR ft. Drake). #DrakeIsLiiiife </p>
